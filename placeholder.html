	<h1>ReviewPower.biz Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>If you have a website that outlines what you do and has your contact info on it that is a start. However, if you have a website that outlines why your a professional in your field or the best in your field that's even better. If you use the other tools on the internet like social media and citation listings that is also good(thumbs up) if you don’t bad(thumbs down).</p>

	<p>If your business website looks just like your competitors it's likely that neither one of you is doing all that good to come up in client searches. Differentiate yourself from the pack outline what makes you or your business better than the competition and if you’re not better than your competition maybe it is time to close up shop as you don’t sound like you enjoy being there. Follow your bliss!</p>

	<p>When it comes to business you need to realize that everything you do is marketing. From sending an email, designing your logo too creating a special message to entice new customers. Are you aware of that? Are you persistently aware of that, you should be!</p>

	<p>Make your website the marketing front end for your business, even if you have a storefront that is in a bustling area if you want to attract new people to that area likely that is going to happen through the internet: Maybe through search (google, yahoo etc …), could also be through social media you post some great photos on Instagram right, great place to show off your passions and entice those people that think like you, Maybe it is on that Medium thing where anyone can write about what they believe in…</p>

	<p>My point is the possibilities for getting your unique message out there are endless and you really should be taking advantage of them</p>

	<p>Review Based Slant (Original Purpose of writing the piece)</p>

	<p>Your website is a great place to list your expertise and to make sure people know both how to find your business and get ahold of you if they want to. But, do you realize that it is also a great place to toot your own horn and put the reviews that people write about you and your business. </p>

	<p>Finding a way to get your customer reviews and testimonials on to the internet is invaluable to letting potential new customers know what they stand to gain by patronizing your business. Think about it more people search not just for businesses but for reviews of the type of business or service that they are looking for. What could be better than to collect all of your reviews and have them displayed on your web page no matter what the review source is yelp, google, nextdoor, angieslist, surecritic etc …</p>

	<h4 style="text-align: center">Well I know how you can do that!</h4>

	<p>Reviewpower.biz is the tool you need to not only collect all your reviews and display them on your website but also to help you collect more reviews. Sounds great doesn't it. Think of it a page on your website that you can send any of your former or current clients to that will allow them to leave a review on the platform of their choice. </p>

	<p>Well I can take that one step further. What if there was a way to increase the number of good reviews that you receive and help to reduce the number of bad reviews that a disappointed client can leave you? We all try to get things write when doing business but sometimes a client ends up being dissatisfied. Most of the time that is due to a miscommunication or something. Well with the reviewpower.biz tool your review collection interface makes it so that you can intercept a review that is less than say four stars and turn it into a contact form so that the upset customer is actually contacting you, the business owner, giving you an opportunity to interface with them and try to rectify the situation. I know awesome right!</p>

	<p>Let’s take it one step further than this. You have a customer list right. Let’s put that list to work and communicate with them about the service or product that you have provided them. Something like this:</p>

	<div class="excerpt">
		<p>Hi [customer],</p>

		<p>I really appreciated you doing business with me. I also hope the experience met your needs and lived up to your expectations. </p>

		<p>We always strive to give the best service possible but know that in this day and age it's not how things sometimes workout. I would appreciate any feedback that you have about your experience with us and also want an opportunity for my future customers to recognize the level of expertise that I strive for.</p>

		<p>If it's not too much trouble and you are comfortable doing it feel free to leave a review for me here: [your reviewpower.biz reviews page]. </p>

		<p>Thank You,</p>


		<p>[Business Owner]</p>

	<p>Looks pretty good right. The key is that you are not outright asking for a review your making a soft pitch. To be honest many of the review sites like Google and Yelp frown on either soliciting reviews or even worse outright incentivising them. Why because we know that produces falsely flattering reviews and not the truth. We wouldn’t want you or anyone else to get in trouble with any of those powerful behemoths so we take care to tread lightly around them. </p>

	<p>You think it’d be a pain to set this up and email it to all of your clients and you’re right. That’s why reviewpower.biz can do all of that for you including send them out and let you know what the status of each recipients reaction was from opening the email to unsubscribing from it to leaving you a great review. Or a bad review that is the reality of doing business that you can then address with that client to make them a happy customer. </p>

	<h4 style="text-align: center">So, Are you ready to proactively address your reviews!</h4>

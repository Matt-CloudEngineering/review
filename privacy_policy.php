	    			<p>To try and bring you offers that are of interest to you, we have relationships with other companies that we allow to place ads on our Website.  As a result of your visit to our Website, Third-Parties may collect information such as User Data.  For further information, consult the privacy policies of the companies representing the ads and the privacy policies of independent third-party operators.</p>

	    			<p>“Do-Not-Track” (“DNT”) is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-parties.  When you choose to turn on the DNT setting in your browser, your browser sends a special signal to websites, ad networks, plug-in providers, and other web services you encounter while browsing to stop tracking your activity via cookies or other tracking technologies.  We and many Third-Parties do not currently respond to Do-Not-Track browser signals or mechanisms.  See the privacy policies of independent operators with respect to how they respond to DNT signals, as their policies may differ from our own.</p>

This Statement does not reflect the privacy practices of those websites, and you should carefully consult the privacy policies of those sites to learn about their practices.  A link to any third-party site does not mean that we endorse it or the quality or accuracy of information presented on it.
